# Multimodal-Stress-Detection-Using-Raw-Sensor-Signals
It is ML model for stress detection by leveraging raw sensor signals (ECG, GSR, PPG) and integrating heart rate variability (HRV) features with threshold-based classification, validated through performance comparison and feature compression analysis.
